    <h2>About Lisa</h2>
        <p>Hey there! My name is Lisa Martinez and I am a beauty photographer based in Houston, Texas.</p>

        <p> I have 8 years of experience with photography and just recently fell in love with beauty photography in
            particular.
            <br> I am completely self taught, learning from online tutorials and just plain 'ol practice. Since my
            images contain
            a high level of detail I have also had to learn how to retouch. Each and every one of my images are
            retouched
            by me.
        </p>
        <p> I am available for commercial and personal assignments.</p>
